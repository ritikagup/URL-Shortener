# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON- TECHWAVE 
Hi we made this project during Full Stack development with Python Training program, conducted by <b> TechWave </b>.

## About the project :
Designed a website that provides the service of a URL shortener which takes the URL that the user inputs and shortens it by randomly generating a string of up to 6 characters (alphanumeric values). Implemented features such as the sign-in page, 404 error page, and copy button to copy the newly generated URL. The collected data (Original URL, shortened URL, number of visits on the webpage, and date-time of the visit) is stored on the backend in an SQL database. 
<br>

## Tech Stack used :
Python, HTML, SQL, Sqlite3, Flask

## How the program works :
Firstly, it asks for signing in.
Secondly, it opens webpage if authorization is successful, otherwise shows a '404 page not found' error.
Thirdly, it takes url input from the viewer and user clicks on 'Shorten' button to proceed.
Fourthly, the shortened url is generated and shown on screen.
Lastly, there is a copy button to copy the url.
